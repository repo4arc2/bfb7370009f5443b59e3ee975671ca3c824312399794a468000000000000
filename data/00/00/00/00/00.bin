just to check in on me.

472
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:01,166
Ugh, I had a visitor.
She's worried about you.

473
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,625
Wha... Jane sold me out?

474
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,541
She said you were on Midgard.

475
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,333
Well, she is mistaken.

476
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:10,250
I'm obviously in my room, studying.

Oh, you mean Earth.
Sorry, I misunderstood.

480
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:24,791
The locals call it that.
Yes, right. Sorry.

481
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,416
Confused there for a moment.

482
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,916
Me and my study group came down here
for a cultural exchange.

483
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,375
"Cultural exchange."

484
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,708
You know us. We're warriors for knowledge.

485
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:39,416
Hmm. Really?
Then this I have to see for myself.

486
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,375
I'm cutting my trip short.

487
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:42,750
(STUTTERS) You're coming here?

488
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:48,458
And, my sweet son, I expect to see
your full syllabus when I arrive.

489
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,208
Now or never, Hill.

490
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,458
Stand down. We're done here.

492
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,958
I almost feel bad for you, Blondie.

493
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:00,958
Please, you must help me.
My mother is coming.

494
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,708
My suggestion? Start in the corners,
clean your way outward.

495
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,166
Corners, corners...

496
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,291
But it's a sphere.

497
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,875
Ugh. Excuse me, ladies. I'm sorry,
but I must leave early. Again.

498
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,958
Loki, my brother.
I require your assistance.

499

Ah, one step ahead of you, Tiny Thunder.

500
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:25,708
My bro's trying this thing in St. Louis.
Saint... Is it "Louie"?

501
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,375
Anyway, we're about to make

502

-this universe's greatest slingshot.

See you in another thousand years.
Heimdall.

505
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:40,208
No more slingshots. No more destruction.
We need to clean this mess up and go home.

Ha! (CHUCKLES)
Nice one. Almost fell for it.

But she's not my mother.

from another mother, remember?

(WHISTLES) Come on, Ice Bros, let's go.

Wait. You can't leave. Look at this place.

We have a duty to this planet.
You need to clean it up.

No, no, no, no, no.

You do have to stay here,
